	<p id="input">Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. Tacos dorados called flautas, or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled
		with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or barbacoa, rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp.
		TACOS!! Iâ€™ve been following that taco truck around all day. Itâ€™s raining tacos, from out of the sky, tacos,
		donâ€™t even ask why. Make it a double there pal. You see, the refried beans are really just the adhesive necessary
		to apply the soft tortilla to the hard taco shell.
		<br/>
		Um, Tabasco? No thanks, do you have any Cholula? Tacos, tacos, tacos. Itâ€™s taco time all the time. These tacos are
		lit ðŸ”¥. Say taco one more time. Itâ€™s taco time all the time. Give me all your tacos. Tacos for breakfast, lunch
		and dinner. Itâ€™s raining tacos, from out of the sky, tacos, donâ€™t even ask why. How do you feel about hard shelled tacos?
		Itâ€™s long been rumored that the chupacabra is really just a crazed man whoâ€™s local taco shop went out of business.
		Yeah, apparently the taco shack was robbed. They left the money but took the tacos.
		<br/>
		Fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed
		on top of a corn or flour tortilla. Tacos, again? This will be 5 times this week and itâ€™s only Tuesday.
