		Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. Tacos dorados called flautas, or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled
		with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or barbacoa, rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp.
		CARNITAS!! Give me all the tacos, immediately. Um, Tabasco? No thanks, do you have any Cholula? Black or pinto beans?
		50 cent tacos! I’ll take 30. Side of rice and beans, please. BARBACOA!! Make it a double there pal.
		If you were a taco, would you eat yourself? Shrimp tacos are tasty tacos!

		<p id="paragraphTwo">Tacos Al pastor/De Adobada are made of thin pork steaks seasoned with adobo seasoning, then
			skewered and overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and flame-broiled as it spins. It’s
			raining tacos, from out of the sky, tacos, don’t even ask why. Can you put some peppers and onions on that?
			CARNE ASADA!! Carne asada on corn tortillas. Let’s do a beef and a chicken, and one with both. How do you feel
			about hard shelled tacos? Does guac cost extra? Give me all the tacos, immediately.

		dorados called flautas, or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or
